# Portlets in Action book's source code for Liferay #

This project hosts the source code for the examples discussed in [Portlets in Action](http://manning.com/sarin) book written by Ashish Sarin.

Portlets in Action is a comprehensive guide for Java developers with minimal or no experience working with portlets. Fully exploring the Portlet 2.0 API and using widely adopted frameworks like Spring 3.0 Portlet MVC, Hibernate and DWR, it teaches you portal and portlet development by walking you through a Book Catalog portlet and Book Portal examples. The example Book Catalog Portlet, developed incrementally in each chapter of the book, incorporates most key portlet features, and the accompanying source code can be easily adapted and reused by readers. The example Book Portal application in chapter 5 introduces you to the challenges faced in developing web portals.
